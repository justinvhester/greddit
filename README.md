This package is the result of following the "Get started with Go" [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/2KmHtgtEZ1s) on youtube presented by Andrew Gerrand.

## Video review
Clocking in at a paltry 24 minutes and 45 seconds the content covered in this video is dense.

Topics covered include
* Setting up a working environment
* Writting and installing your own go code
* Generalizing and packaging your go code for reuse
* Documentation in go code
* Pushing your work to github
* Ideas for further study

New comers ~~will~~ should abuse the video scroll bar to milk every bit of knowledge from this excellent beginner content.
At some parts of the video you may feel as if you've missed something about what part of a file should be edited.
For me this was a great chance to research on my own and get familiar with the `gofmt` tool which will attempt to help by squawking about every little thing that is out of place in your go code.

## Ideas for the future
When I get a chance to explore further.

- [ ] Implement a command-line interface to specify the subreddit(s) to query.
- [ ] Expand the reddit package to support more of the Reddit API.
- [ ] Learn about Go's concurrency primitives and perform multiple requests in parallel.
